Converting Natural Language to SQL
This repository houses the model used to translate natural language to sql query 

With the vast amount of data generated today and the need to make informed business decisions, a data-driven culture is essential. According to Benard Marr businesses who base their decisions more on data and less on instincts or experience are 19 times more likely to be profitable. This is because the world is ever-changing and so are consumer expectations and behavior but, our ideals and beliefs are less likely to change on par. Unfortunately, there is a lack of technical skill to perform data extraction from databases to support data-driven decisions. This is because it requires extensive training that may be difficult and time-consuming for one to acquire. Also, if lack of skill was not the case , then the greatest issue will be ensuring data privacy if everyone has access to the database. The aim of this project is to interpret queries written in simple English language to SQL format which will then be used to extract information from different tables so that anyone within the organization can access the data they need without much assistance.The process of interpretation can be done by building and training a seq2seq model which effectively the translation of languages from one domain to another.
